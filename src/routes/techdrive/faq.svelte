    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h4>Q: What do we do?</h4>

    <p>
        A: We donate tech to kids who need it. If you have any old technology
        (phones, computers, etc.) , please donate it, even if it doesn't work or
        if it is old. Boxes are located (we are deciding a location). Our goal
        is to stop e-waste and provide everyone with what they need to learn.
    </p>

    <h4>Q: Why should you donate?</h4>

    <p>
        A: What many people don't realize is there are many roadblocks holding
        computers back for around a decade, and you can still use a 15-year-old
        machine nicely now. That makes old computers great for us. Those
        computers can help kids in need with their learning. Your old device
        just needs a chance. <i><b>Give that chance to people in need!</b></i>
    </p>

    <h4>Q: What can I bring?</h4>

    <p>A: Whatever tech you can bring is accepted!</p>

    <h4>Q: Who are you partnered with?</h4>

    <p>
        A: We are partnered with <u>Computers with Causes</u>. Go check them out
        here:
        <a href="https://www.computerswithcauses.org/" target="_blank"
            >https://www.computerswithcauses.org/</a
        >. Your donation helps the charitable programs we support, provides much
        needed educational and vocational assets, and substantially increases
        resources to support our communities. Donate a Computer and write it off
        on your taxes! Business donors can deduct the underappreciated value of
        the computer, and individuals can deduct the current market value of a
        computer. Tax Deductions! We may be able to give you a tax receipt. We
        take your tech and donate it to <u>Computers with Causes</u>. They, in
        turn, will give the computer to people who are in need, such as
        low-income students who need electronic devices for online school and
        other purposes. If your tech is broken, as much as possible will be
        salvaged, and then the rest will be recycled into new tech.
        iCloud&trade; locked phones are 100% accepted! iCloud&trade; locked
        phones are phones which you don't have a password for and don't have any
        data you want on it, or phones that ask for a iCloud&trade; password.
        Any password locked phones that don't let you use a new user profile. We
        will send a activation request to Apple<small>&reg;</small>, with the
        information of the phone we got. We may send you a email to remove it
        from your iCloud&trade; account
