    <h2>What is the ISB tech drive?</h2>

    <p>
        The ISB tech drive is a chance for people in need to get computers,
        phones, tablets, and other devices. If you have any old technology
        (phones, computers, etc.), please donate it, even if it doesn't work or
        if it is old, because we can fix it. Our goal is to stop e-waste and
        provide everyone with what they need to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
        What many people don't realize is there are many roadblocks holding
        computers back for around a decade, and you can still use a 15-year-old
        machine nicely now. That makes old computers great for us, because they
        can still help kids in need with their learning. Your old device just
        needs a chance. <i><b>Give that chance to people in need!</b></i>
