                We will attempt to repair the device, if it does not work by any
                means then it will be salvaged for parts then recycled. The
                parts will go to FreeGeek, a company based in Portland for

                Desktop PCs were the most common thing a while ago, they are
                highly upgradable, and we can upgrade it to today's standards.
                This stuff is very common and they are <b>INCREDIBLE</b>! Great
                for higher grades, where any student take on demanding tasks,
                such as filmmaking, and lot more!

                Kids at ISB who need a cable of some sort can receive them.
                Laptop chargers fail often, and if it is a proprietary cable,
                then it is going to be very hard to find it normally. We can get
                you a special charger if we have it. If it's listed in the
                Donation List page; linked below, then send us a email if it's
                still available! ISBtechdrive@hotmail.com

                Computer accessories help people who have a computer thing given
                to them by their school, but don't have the port for it. As most
                intel macbooks released from 2016 to 2020 have needed adapters
                to plug most accessories in. Docks are incredible! Speakers,
                keyboards, mice, and trackpads can be donated.
